//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*  
    Below is a cart array that has food objects
    inside. 

    Write a callback below that uses the reduce
    array method to calculate the sum of all
    the food. 
*/

const cart = [
    {
        name: 'pizza', 
        price: 9.99
    }, 
    {
        name: 'pasta', 
        price: 8.99
    }, 
    {
        name: 'salad', 
        price: 7.99
    }
]

//CODE HERE
const cartTotal = (object, cb) => {
    let total = object.reduce(function(a, b){
        return a + b.price
    }, 0)
    cb(total)
}
// const summedPrice = cart.reduce(/* CALLBACK HERE */)
const summPrice = cartTotal(cart, answer=> {
    console.log(answer)
})
//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*  
    Write a function called `calcFinalPrice` that
    can take in `cartTotal`,`couponValue`,
    and `tax` arguments. 

    Inside the function, calculate the tax 
    on the cartTotal and add it in. Subtract
    the value of the coupon. Return the final
    number. 

    Note: the numbers passed in for `tax` will be
    decimals, for example: .06 for a 6% tax.
*/

//CODE HERE
const calcFinalPrice = (cartTotal, couponValue, tax) => {
    let final = (cartTotal * (tax + 1) - couponValue)
    console.log(final)
}

calcFinalPrice(26.97, 20, .06)

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*  
    In this problem, you'll create a model for 
    a customer object as well as an example
    object. 

    Plan out a customer object for the cart page.
    Think about the information that a 
    restaurant would need about its customers.

    In the TEXT ANSWER area below, describe the
    properties that your customer object will have
    and why you chose those properties.

    Explain what data types each property should be
    and why you chose those data types. 

    Your object should have at least 4 properties. 
*/

/*
    TEXT ANSWER HERE
    The customer object should have properties
    for the following:
        -Full name(string)
        -Address(string)
        -Duration of membership with the store(number)
        -amount spent within the year(number)

    The customer object should have properties
    for the following: 
        - first name (string)
        - last name (string)
        - address (string)
        - city (string)
        - state (string)
        - zip code (number)
        - phone number (number)
    
    It's important for the restaurant to have 
    contact information in case they need to 
    speak with a customer or deliver an order

    All of the string properties would not work
    as numbers, except perhaps address. But I set
    it up so that the house number and street name
    are both stored in that string. 

    I decided to keep the zip code and phone number
    as numbers since that's more accurate than making
    them strings even though they could be.

/*
    Now, create a customer object following your own
    guidelines.
*/

//CODE HERE
let customer = {
    name: `Spencer Tonga`,
    Address: `8000 s south pole, antarctica`,
    years: `6`,
    yeartodate: 2598.5
}
